//! A crate for building and loading Mago's "prelude".
//!
//! The prelude contains the pre-compiled `Database` and `CodebaseMetadata` for all
//! of PHP's built-in symbols (functions, classes, constants, etc.). This is
//! essential for providing accurate analysis, especially in environments like WASM
//! where stubs cannot be loaded from the filesystem.
//!
//! ## Workflow
//!
//! This crate is split into two parts using a feature flag:
//!
//! 1.  **At Compile Time (with the `build` feature):**
//!     - A `build.rs` script enables the `build` feature for this crate.
//!     - It calls `Prelude::build()` to perform the expensive, one-time analysis of all stub files.
//!     - It then calls `prelude.encode()` to serialize the result into a byte slice.
//!     - The bytes are written to a file (e.g., `prelude.bin`) in the `OUT_DIR`.
//!
//! 2.  **At Runtime (without the `build` feature):**
//!     - The main application uses `include_bytes!` to embed the `prelude.bin` file.
//!     - It calls `Prelude::decode()` on the bytes to instantly reconstruct the prelude in memory.
