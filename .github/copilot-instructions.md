# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This document serves as a guide to leveraging GitHub Copilot for working within the `sdc-build-wp` repo. See `README.md` for more information about this package. Below are the essential instructions and guidelines:

## Watch Commands

Whenever a new watch command is added, be sure to add it to the README, the `lib/help.js` file, and the log that outputs the available commands.

## Code Standards

- All JavaScript and TypeScript code should adhere to the formatting rules specified in `eslint.config.js` whenever possible.
- Comments are useful and welcome, but aim for clear and concise code over heavily-commented code. Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance readability.
